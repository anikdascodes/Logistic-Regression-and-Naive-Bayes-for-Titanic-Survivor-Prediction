# Titanic Survivor Prediction

## Overview
This project implements machine learning models to predict survival outcomes of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The analysis uses two classification algorithms: Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster based on various features from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about 891 passengers on the Titanic, including:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Target variable (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger's name
- **Sex**: Passenger's gender
- **Age**: Passenger's age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)



## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (for running the notebook)
